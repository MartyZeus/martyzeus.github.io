    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
      Milestone Marketing Solutions (MMS) is a direct-to-consumer marketing
      firm, initially entirely focused on mail-based lead generation. When I
      was hired an 'Email Marketing Specialist', the company I had been
      undergoing a transition period after being acquired by Spectrum
      Automotive Holdings. My role was based around a sister company,
      Automotive Product Consultants (APC), offloading their email marketing
      programs to Milestone and a need for additional assistance in the
      transition and scaling of these programs. The programs involved
      partnering with automotive dealership groups and service contract
      administrators to market dealership customers with the goal of driving
      leads to a variety of call center. Over the first few months I mostly
      shadowed the creative director who act as the manager of the email
      marketing team. Both our team and APC's team worked out of Salesforce
      Marketing Cloud Engagement (SFMC) instance.
    </p>
    <p>
      APC's processes involved exporting txt files of records from their in
      house CRM, transferring them via SFTP to the Marketing Cloud instance,
      importing the records into lists, and manually scheduling email send
      jobs for the week. Emails were built with chained if statements using
      dynamic content, ContentImageByKey() was used to dynamically load
      dealership logos into the emails, A/B testing was executed using SMFC's
      native testing feature. Our creative director had enhanced the program
      by implementing the use of Automation Studio to import, segment records
      by timezone using SQL queries, and send emails. He also enhanced the
      emails by dynamically personalize email content using AMPscript.
    </p>
    <p>
      After gaining an understanding of the SFMC platform, taking Salesforce
      Trailhead courses, and getting my Marketing Cloud Engagement Foundations
      certification, I began taking a more active role in the automation and
      management of the Marketing Cloud instance. I started by working with
      our SQL Development team to set up an A/B testing process to maintain
      reporting at our SQL server.

    <h2>Email Marketing Developer</h2>
    <p>
      <span class="expDesc">January 2024 - December 2025</span><br /><br />
      After showing a strong understanding of programming concepts and an
      automation mindset, I moved to being a developer primarily while our
      creative director handled the planning of email campaigns. My first
      major enhancement was beginning the utilization of SSJS in our
      automation processes, expanded our dynamic email generation using
      AMPscript, and script the validation and cleaning of data with
      PowerShell.
