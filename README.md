# martyzeus.github.io

martyzeus.github.io is Alexander Martin's personal website. He is using it as a way to try to learn more about about programming, HTML/CSS in particular. Alexander is not actively looking for new work and enjoys his current role, he just likes to program outside of work too.

## Why Make a Website?

Alexander is an email system administrator; he builds and manages systems that automate the large scale deployment of emails. This includes dynamically building HTML files for emails. So why would he put his free time into making a website? Well the CSS in emails doesn't utilize classes, instead everything is inline. Alexander wants to build a robust HTML engine for his company in hopes that they will continue paying him money and he continue buying expensive computer parts and trying out random new hobbies every few weeks. 

## Structure

Alexander is figuring this out as he goes, at the root level you have .gitignore, my CNAME, index.html, and README.md (I hope you are aware of the file you are reading).

### css

Alexander is storing styles.css here, does he need any other CSS files?

### images

Alexander is storing any images he may need here, there will likely be more in-depth structure but who knows.

### projects

This is where all the sub pages of projects will live. They will start out with a general overview file with further folders and files detailing specific aspects of the projects.

### resume

The goal of this section is for it to act more as a timeline of Alexander's career and professional life. While he is not currently looking for new work, its better to have one built and not need it, than to have to need new work and have to build it entirely from the ground up.
